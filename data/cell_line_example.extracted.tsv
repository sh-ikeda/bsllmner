SAMD00123367	{"cell_line": "H1299"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "H1299". 3. Since I found a cell line name in the input data, I will extract it and create a new JSON output with the extracted cell line name.  Here is my output:  {"cell_line": "H1299"}  Let me know if this is correct!
SAMD00235411	{"cell_line": "SKNO-1"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "SKNO-1". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "SKNO-1".  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "SKNO-1"}
SAMD00316482	{"cell_line": "MDA-MB-453"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON data: {   "accession": "SAMD00316482",   "cell line": "MDA-MB-453",   "organism": "Homo sapiens",   "sample name": "ATAC_11-19_no_37",   "title": "MB453_exp_ERa-E380Q_ATAC_11-19_no_37" }  2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "MDA-MB-453".  3. Since the input data contains a cell line name, I extract it and create a new JSON object with the extracted information.  4. The output will be: {"cell_line": "MDA-MB-453"}  So, my response is:  {"cell_line": "MDA-MB-453"}
SAMD00324177	{"cell_line": "NCI-H2122"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell_line" with a value of "NCI-H2122". 3. Since I found a cell line name in the input data, I will extract it and create a new JSON output with the extracted cell line name.  Here is my output:  {"cell_line": "NCI-H2122"}  Let me know if this is correct!
SAMD00596646	{"cell_line": "HFF-1"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains a cell line name. In this case, I notice that there is a key called `"cell_line"` with a value of `"HFF-1"`. 3. Since I found a cell line name, I will extract it and create a new JSON object with the extracted information. 4. The output will be: `{"cell_line": "HFF-1"}`  So, here is the result:  `{"cell_line": "HFF-1"}`
SAMEA4028888	{"cell_line": "None"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that the "sample description" field mentions "B-lymphoblastoids", which could be related to a cell line. 3. However, there is no explicit mention of a specific cell line name in the input data. 4. Since I couldn't find any clear indication of a cell line name, my output will be: {"cell_line": "None"}  Is that correct?
SAMEA4753711	{"cell_line": "Het1A"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. The input data is in JSON format, which I can parse. 2. I need to check if the sample is a cell line. To do this, I'll look for keywords like "cell line", "cell type", or other related terms in the metadata. 3. Upon inspection, I notice that there is a field called "cell line" with value "Het1A". This suggests that the sample is indeed a cell line. 4. Since I found a cell line name, I will extract it and output it in JSON format.  Here's my response:  {"cell_line": "Het1A"}  Let me know if this is correct!
SAMEA4799826	{"cell_line": "L3.6pl"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of a sample for a biological experiment. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I find that the input data has a key called "cell line" with a value of "L3.6pl". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the input data. 5. The extracted cell line name is "L3.6pl".  According to the instructions, my output should be in JSON format, so I generate the following response:  {"cell_line": "L3.6pl"}  Is this correct?
SAMEA4957855	{"cell_line": "None"}	Let's analyze the input data step by step.  1. The input data is in JSON format, which is easy to parse. 2. We need to check if the sample is a cell line or not. Typically, cell lines have specific names like HeLa, Jurkat, HEK293, etc. 3. Looking at the input data, I don't see any obvious indication that this sample is a cell line. There are no specific keywords or phrases that suggest it's a cell line. 4. The "cell type" field has a value of "fibroblast", which suggests that it's a primary cell culture rather than a cell line.  Since we couldn't find any evidence that the sample is a cell line, our output should be:  {"cell_line": "None"}  Let me know if this is correct!
SAMN08200557	{"cell_line": "H9"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I'll check if the input data contains any information that suggests it's a cell line. 2. Upon reviewing the data, I notice that there is a field called `"originating cell line"` with value `"H9"`. This could be a potential candidate for the cell line name. 3. Since `"H9"` is indeed a well-known human embryonic stem cell line, I'm confident that this is the cell line name we're looking for.  So, my output will be:  `{"cell_line": "H9"}`  Let me know if this looks correct!
SAMN12723276	{"cell_line": "PC-3"}	Let's break it down step by step:  1. I receive the JSON formatted metadata of the sample. 2. I check if the input data contains information about a cell line. 3. In this case, I notice that there is a key called "cell line" with a value of "PC-3". 4. Since the input data explicitly mentions a cell line, I extract the cell line name from the value associated with the "cell line" key. 5. The extracted cell line name is "PC-3".  Therefore, my output will be:  {"cell_line": "PC-3"}  Let me know if this is correct!
