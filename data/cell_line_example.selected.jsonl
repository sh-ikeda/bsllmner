{"accession": "SAMN12723276", "output": {"cell_line_id": "CVCL:0035"}, "output_full": "After comparing the input JSON with each term, I calculated a confidence score for each term based on the matching information. Here are the results:\n\n**CVCL_4055.json**: Confidence score = 0.2\nThe term has a related synonym \"pc3\" that matches the extracted cell line name, but the name and exact synonyms do not match exactly. The disease information does not match the sample's disease (Prostate carcinoma).\n\n**CVCL_0035.json**: Confidence score = 0.9\nThe term has an exact match with the extracted cell line name \"PC-3\". Additionally, the disease information matches the sample's disease (Prostate carcinoma), and the cell line type is also a match.\n\n**CVCL_C8XA.json**: Confidence score = 0.1\nThe term has a related synonym \"pc3\" that matches the extracted cell line name, but the name and exact synonyms do not match exactly. The disease information does not match the sample's disease (Prostate carcinoma).\n\n**CVCL_4011.json**: Confidence score = 0.4\nThe term has a related synonym \"PC-3\" that matches the extracted cell line name, but the name and exact synonyms do not match exactly. Although the disease information is related to cancer, it does not match the sample's specific disease (Prostate carcinoma).\n\n**CVCL_S982.json**: Confidence score = 0.6\nThe term has a related synonym \"PC-3\" that matches the extracted cell line name, and the exact synonyms also include \"pc-3\". However, the disease information does not match the sample's disease (Prostate carcinoma), which reduces the confidence score.\n\nBased on these calculations, I conclude that **CVCL_0035.json** is the most likely to represent the input sample, with a confidence score of 0.9.\n\nOutput: {\"cell_line_id\": \"CVCL:0035\"}"}
